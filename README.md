Multisignature (multisig) wallets are smart contracts that allow multiple signers to review and agree on an action on the blockchain before the action is executed.

In this app we can multiple owner and also current owner can remove other owner's also. Here can we can create transaction with payee address and amount(wei). After creating transaction all current owner must be approved the transaction only after that amount will be deposit to payee address. We can see on dashboard how many current owner's are approved the transaction and pending. Once all the owners approve the transaction then we get option to sumit the transaction and after sumbit the transaction will become to done state.

Note: If current user is not in owner list then that user can't remove other owenr's and also not approve the current transaction, only
current owner's have access to add new owner.
